## Timelines

Timelines enable data traces, whether one or many, to be heard over time. 

## Sonifications of Services on Android while running. 

This sonification displays the times of the locations, Bluetooth, and WiFi services during a
run of the UnheardCity application. 

The MIDI was create in Python before being output to GarageBand and using the SoCal drum sounds. 

Locations are sonified as the hi-hat. 

Bluetooth are sonified as the snare.

WiFi are sonified as a bass drum. 

The overall idea was t use the drum kit as a way of both separating each timeline, while also identifying a way of suggesting their
integration into a wider whole.
